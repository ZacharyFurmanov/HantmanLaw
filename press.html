  <p class="press-description">"De Niro lets his hair down “About My Father” is about funnyman Sebastian Maniscalco’s hairdresser father. Their friend Robert De Niro plays him. De Niro: “I was in ‘The Irishman’ with Sebastian. This is a personal element from his life. A classic Italian family comedy cultural clash with WASPy stiff in-laws. His actual father was my model. I always want a real element in anyone I play. We met in Oklahoma while shooting a movie. “Actors I admired included Gregory Peck and James Dean who only did three movies but was excellent. I never worked with Montgomery Clift. Brando, always great, I knew personally. I worked with terrific Robert Mitchum twice.” In this is Kim Cattrall. Opens May 26. Go. Take your father. Maybe he’ll do your hair."</p>

  <p class="press-description">FIRST ON FOX: Houston Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr. is accused of attacking girlfriend Kysre Gondrezick in a New York City hotel room earlier this week, but her attorney told Fox News Digital the allegations aren't accurate. "Statements that were attributed to her were not her words," said Gondrezick's lawyer, Robert Hantman, referring to a criminal complaint. "She says he didn’t strike her repeatedly. He’s a big guy. If he hit her repeatedly, she’d have a broken jaw."</p>

  <p class="press-description">Not so long ago, it seemed to Rudolph W. Giuliani that he would be presiding over a hefty part of the world. Holding court a few nights after the 2016 election in a private cigar bar on Fifth Avenue, glass of Macallan at hand, Mr. Giuliani boasted to friends that President-elect Donald J. Trump would soon nominate him to the most prestigious of cabinet posts.</p>

  <h3 class="press-headline">Rudy Giuliani’s Ukraine smear case started with splashy Hollywood deal gone bad — and a cameo from Jack Nicholson</h3>
  <p class="press-description">A Hollywood deal that went sideways gave federal investigators clues to unravel the explosive scheme to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine — a plot that could land America’s Mayor behind bars. Lev Parnas, one of Rudy Giuliani’s shady Soviet emigre partners in an alleged scheme to boost President Trump’s reelection, also once scammed a friend out of $350,000 that he claimed was a loan to help fund a proposed flick called “Memory of a Killer,” a Long Island federal judge ruled.</p>

  <p class="press-description">Billy McFarland, the creator of the failed 2017 Fyre Festival, on Tuesday requested to be released early from prison and serve the remainder of his six year sentence under "home confinement." McFarland cited the coronavirus spread in the Ohio prison where he is currently being held as the reason he should be released, according to court documents obtained Thursday by CBS News. McFarland's request for compassionate release was made in a letter sent from his attorneys to Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawyers argue in the letter that McFarland's "preexisting conditions" make him "particularly vulnerable to catching and suffering from severe or fatal consequences of the virus."</p>

But Shafrazi, 71, is fighting back. The dealer’s lawyer Robert Hantman filed suit for $8 million Friday in Manhattan Supreme Court accusing the landlord of fraud and breach of contract.</p>

  <h3 class="press-headline">Agent suing Clemente family over ‘unpaid fees’</h3>
  <p class="press-description">A branding agent who’s worked with Derek Jeter and Miss America is suing the family of the late baseball great Roberto Clemente over almost $1 million in unpaid fees. Manhattan-based Wicked Cow Entertainment was hired in 2011 by Roberto’s son Luis to cash in on the Hall of Famer’s “name, likeness and image” according to the Manhattan Supreme Court suit.</p>

  <h3 class="press-headline">Rapper Rick Ross on the Run From Lawsuit</h3>
  <p class="press-description">During a promoter's attempt to find Rick Ross, a registered address for the rapper turned out to be a UPS store, lawyers claim. You would think it would be easy to find a 300-pound rapper covered head-to-toe in tattoos — but a concert promoter is complaining to a federal judge that Rick Ross elaborately ducked court papers for six months in a blockbuster lawsuit against him.</p>

  <h3 class="press-headline">Magic Johnson ‘stuck a knife in my back’: lawsuit</h3>
  <p class="press-description">After Dodgers co-owner Magic Johnson got in hot water with Major League Baseball for his comments about Yankee slugger Robinson Cano, he’s now had a setback in a federal court. A Florida judge is allowing a case against the former NBA star to proceed, alleging he broke an agreement to market and sell a prepaid credit card — called the Magic Cash Card — and then made a similar deal with competitor OneWest Bank to hawk a similarly-named prepaid plastic.</p>
